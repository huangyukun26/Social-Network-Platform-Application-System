# 2024 BJFU NOSQL Database Course Design --Social Network System（I came in first in the comprehensive assessment）

## Introduction

This course is designed to study the design and implementation of social network platform systems.

The main functional modules include user management, friend relationship management, dynamic publishing and interaction, message system, personalized recommendation, search system and data analysis module. By being independent of each other, the modular design is maintained to facilitate subsequent expansion.

The structural design of the system adopts a distributed architecture, combined with the characteristics of NoSQL database, to ensure the efficient operation of each module and data consistency. At the same time, considering the high concurrency requirements, the system integrates caching and message queue services to support real-time data updates and user interaction, and strives to achieve high system response performance and user experience.

Key Features:

- User authentication & authorization
- Post creation & interaction (likes, comments)
- Friend relationship management (follow, friend requests,friend recommendation, social network analysis)
- Real-time private messaging
- Notification system (likes, comments, follows, friend requests)
- Search system (user search, post serach, serach recommendation)
- User profile management
- Image upload & preview
- Online status display
- Data caching optimization

## Demo

This project has not been fully developed and is very crude. I have not yet deployed it to the server. Please use the local view.
